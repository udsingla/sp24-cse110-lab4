1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. Error: This is because when we use let to define a variable, it has a block scope and cannot be accessed outside of the block it has been defined in. Line 13 is outside of the block that contains the definition of variable result, leading to an error where the variable hasn't been defined.
5. The code would return an error as we are trying to change the value of a const variable in line 7. This is not allowed as a const variable value cannot be changed once it is defined.
6. The code will give an error as given in the above answer. Considering we fix that, this line would still give an error as const variable has block scope as well just like defining a variable with let. This would mean that the value of variable result is not available outside of the block and line 13 cannot access it, leading to an error where the variable hasn't been defined.
